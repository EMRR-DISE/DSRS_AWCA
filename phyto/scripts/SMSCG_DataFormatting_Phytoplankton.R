#Notes
#For all BSA files from 2013 to 2021, the column "Number of cells per unit" really means "Total cells", 
#which is the total number of cells counted for that taxon in a particular sample
#calculations in this script were corrected accordingly on 2/10/2022

#create version of data set for phytoplankton synthesis effort
#just needs to include the samples specific to the SMSCG action
#hard to split the SMSCG and EMP data sets because NZS42 and NZ032 station names are
#shared by the two surveys
#probably should add a column to the imported data sets with the source file
#that will allow us to keep track of which samples are from which survey

#to do list
#should check to see if organisms per ml and cells per ml are equal for cases where phyto_form = individual
