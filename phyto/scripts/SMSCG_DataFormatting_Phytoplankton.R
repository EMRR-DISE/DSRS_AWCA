#Delta Smelt Resiliency Strategy

#Format raw data in preparation for visualization and analysis

#To do list-----------
#need to correct biovolumes

#required packages
library(tidyverse) #suite of data science tools
library(janitor) #functions for cleaning up data sets
library(hms) #working with date/time
library(lubridate) #working with dates
library(readxl) #importing data from excel files
#library(algaeClassify) #grab taxonomy info from AlgaeBase; doesn't work currently

#Notes
#For all BSA files from 2013 to 2021, the column "Number of cells per unit" really means "Total cells", 
#which is the total number of cells counted for that taxon in a particular sample
#calculations in this script were corrected accordingly on 2/10/2022
